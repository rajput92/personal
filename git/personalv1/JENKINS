Basic two ways to start jenkins:

Jenkins WEB Start --> run and save JNLP file--> jenkins downloaded --> run on browser

WAR based file --> java -jar jenkins.war (executable WAR file)

Application Tomcat Server --> place jwnkins.war in webapps folder

Configure JDK and Maven --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure SYstem

junit --> test reports are genrated in target/surefire-reports folder in XML format

Publish javadoc--> to find java doc

Invoke Goals :  mvn clean install, mvn javadoc:javadco cobertura

jenkins install linux -- yyum packages --> located in /usr/lin/jenkins--> java -jar jenkins.war file --> to start first time

jenkins build will take much memroy resources, cpu--> so we ahve created separate user and group named jenkin--> will help in analysing resources consumed by groups

where build configuration, plugins, configuration stored --> jenkins home directory-->~/.jenkins

JENKINS_HOME, JENKINS_BASE --> customised jenkins.war and home directoery

if you are running behinf tocat server -> write env varibles in jenkins.xml files

default jenkins.war --> usr/lib/jenins or usr/sahre/jenkins
default jenins home directory --> var/lib/jenkins
log files --> var/log/jenkins
jenkin config parameters like jdk and port --> etc/sysconfig/jenkins

service jenkins start/stop/status

how to run as a standalone --> bu running just war file

behind apache server --> to make jenkins running behine dfirewall, can be aaccess from web url

behind application server --> not able to restart jenkins server directly, neither upgrade

how to make jenkins as a service in linux : write jenkins.service file with some parameters at /etc/systemctl/jenkins.service

jenkins home directory : 
    users: user list with config.xml file having password and access native user db
    plugins
    updates
    secrets : initial admin password
    logs : job tasks logs
    jobs : build working directory
        build : bbuild history, build logs, 
        workspace : source code checkout and generated artifacts after compilation, reports of each build with timestamp, archieving artiafcts
        config.xml : configuration for that project
        
jenkins executable is less critical, as it can be reinstalled withought effecting any data

how to upgrade jenkins--> just replace the jenkins.war, and no to make sure no job is running
    
jenkins config regarding installation port --> etc folder

jenkins job build system configurstion --> config.xml in jenkins_home directory

Migrating jenkins --> manage jenkins --> load system from disk --> whole jenkins_home direcotry parsed

where to configure git url, jdk ,maven, plugins --> configure global tools configuration

system log : jenkins server logs for trouyble shooting

Tools installation : global tools configuration


how to restart jenkins manuallu ---> jenkinsurl/restart

to unistall jenkins --> unisnatsll script from jenkinsbase or 

schedule jobs in jenkins --> cron job --> min. hr. day month. weekday

export import jobs --> tar java-homedir--> untar--> relod config from disk

why cant we login as jenkins user asfter installing jenkins, also user is present in /etc/password :  bcz jenkins user is a service account and service not configure for /bin/bash--> so sudo su -s /bin/bash jenkins

How can I make Jenkins CI with git trigger on pushes to master? --> github-posthook-trigger-->http://yourserver/jenkins/git/notifyCommit?url=<URL of the Git repository>?token=<get token from git to build remotely>

reset security settings command line --> var/lib/jenkins/confix.xml--> security false--> make new entries--> restart jenkins

no html pages, instead txt files --> configure global security--> markup formater --> safe html

Jenkins Host key verification failed --> try to run command manually --> so that new entry happens in known_hosts

How to start jenkins on different port rather than 8080 using command prompt in Windows? --> java -jar -hhtps=

How to install a plugin in Jenkins manually--> download .hpi--> put it in ~/.jenkins/plugins

Show current state of Jenkins build on GitHub repo -- > 1. genrate token in github--< cheecke boxes-->paste it in jenkins github credetials-->test--> post build job--> set build status on github commit

Changing Jenkins build number --> jenkins script console --> Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName("YourJobName").updateNextBuildNumber(45)

How do I clone a job in jenkins? --> copy existing job

what is discard old build jobs means : two options : 1: delete job based one no. of days2: delete jobs if certain max no. rached
    its works for deletions of artifacts as well

How to pass variables, that will asked during ongoing builds : this project is parameterized

How to run jobs on specific agents : restrict where the project can be run--> assign agents label

suppose multiple commits at same time, so builds will be in queue : so use quiet period , so jenkins will wait for time after first commit

retry count : make jenkins to check SCM no. of times , to make build starts otherwise than fail

block build from upstream/downstream running : build will be in queu if parent or child running

hwo to checkout specific directory/branch : addtitional behaviour

enable concurrent build for this project : multiple jobs run simultaneously for current project

if you want your build to be run based on some snapshot jar crreation --> Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built

how to trigger based on some scripts remotely or for github trigger with the help of token:  trigger builds remotely 

BUild env:
if you run some commadns or sends some files before running your build (both for before build and after build)--> builf trigger --> send files executes command scheckbox

PRE STEPS/POST STEPS: execute windows batch command-->execute shell--> invoke maven targets--> 

jenkins job configuration stored in --> config.xml--> so to migrate--> either copy job folder and rename or JENKINSCLI:
    list job-->get jobname--> as an xml--> create an job from xml

how to configure jenkins web site root path --> manage jenkins--> copnfigure system

how to stop zombie job in jenkins --> jenkins script console --> Jenkins .instance.getItemByFullName("JobName")
        .getBuildByNumber(JobNumber)
        .finish(hudson.model.Result.ABORTED, new java.io.IOException("Aborting build")); 
        
Jenkins dead but pid file exists --> mostly error with apache port -> chnage jenkins_ajp_port = 8009 in etc/sysconfig/jenkins

host verification failed when cloning from repo--> so you added into known_hosts--> than also same error--> please check for permission on public and private key for ssh--> is it assign to jenkins

from where you can know directory for jenkins.war folder --> manage jenkins--> system info

Jenkins not executing jobs (pending - waiting for next executor) -> might be due to disk space issue in master 

Jenkins - j_acegi_security_check --> tomact gives error after log in --> please enble security --> jenkins users own db and allow sign up
