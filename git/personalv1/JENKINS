Basic two ways to start jenkins:

Jenkins disadvantages :

Jenkins doesn’t allow one developer to see the commits done by another team member, readily. This makes tracking the overall release progress a rather difficult job for larger projects. This can cause a lot of trouble to the release manager.

Jenkins doesn’t provide any analytics (there are plugins but they are not enough) on the end-to-end deployment cycle. This again goes back to the lack of overall tracking that contributes to the lack of analytics as well.

While Jenkins is indeed a powerful and useful tool, managing a Jenkins server needs special attention and many times, a dedicated developer. This adds man hours to the project and pushes up the overall project cost as well.


Jenkins WEB Start --> run and save JNLP(Java Network Launching Protocol) file--> jenkins downloaded --> run on browser

WAR based file --> java -jar jenkins.war (executable WAR file)

Application Tomcat Server --> place jwnkins.war in webapps folder

Configure JDK and Maven --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure SYstem

junit --> test reports are genrated in target/surefire-reports folder in XML format

Publish javadoc--> to find java doc

Invoke Goals :  mvn clean install, mvn javadoc:javadco cobertura

jenkins install linux -- yyum packages --> located in /usr/lin/jenkins--> java -jar jenkins.war file --> to start first time

jenkins build will take much memroy resources, cpu--> so we ahve created separate user and group named jenkin--> will help in analysing resources consumed by groups

where build configuration, plugins, configuration stored --> jenkins home directory-->~/.jenkins

JENKINS_HOME, JENKINS_BASE --> customised jenkins.war and home directoery

if you are running behinf tocat server -> write env varibles in jenkins.xml files

default jenkins.war --> usr/lib/jenins or usr/sahre/jenkins
default jenins home directory --> var/lib/jenkins
log files --> var/log/jenkins
jenkin config parameters like jdk and port --> etc/sysconfig/jenkins

service jenkins start/stop/status

how to run as a standalone --> bu running just war file

behind apache server --> to make jenkins running behine dfirewall, can be aaccess from web url

behind application server --> not able to restart jenkins server directly, neither upgrade

how to make jenkins as a service in linux : write jenkins.service file with some parameters at /etc/systemctl/jenkins.service

jenkins home directory : 
    users: user list with config.xml file having password and access native user db
    plugins
    updates
    secrets : initial admin password
    logs : job tasks logs
    jobs : build working directory
        build : bbuild history, build logs, 
        workspace : source code checkout and generated artifacts after compilation, reports of each build with timestamp, archieving artiafcts
        config.xml : configuration for that project
        
jenkins executable is less critical, as it can be reinstalled withought effecting any data

how to upgrade jenkins--> just replace the jenkins.war, and no to make sure no job is running
    
jenkins config regarding installation port --> etc folder

jenkins job build system configurstion --> config.xml in jenkins_home directory

Migrating jenkins --> manage jenkins --> load system from disk --> whole jenkins_home direcotry parsed

where to configure git url, jdk ,maven, plugins --> configure global tools configuration

system log : jenkins server logs for trouyble shooting

Tools installation : global tools configuration


how to restart jenkins manuallu ---> jenkinsurl/restart

to unistall jenkins --> unisnatsll script from jenkinsbase or 

schedule jobs in jenkins --> cron job --> min. hr. day month. weekday

export import jobs --> tar java-homedir--> untar--> relod config from disk

why cant we login as jenkins user asfter installing jenkins, also user is present in /etc/password :  bcz jenkins user is a service account and service not configure for /bin/bash--> so sudo su -s /bin/bash jenkins

How can I make Jenkins CI with git trigger on pushes to master? --> github-posthook-trigger-->http://yourserver/jenkins/git/notifyCommit?url=<URL of the Git repository>?token=<get token from git to build remotely>

reset security settings command line --> var/lib/jenkins/confix.xml--> security false--> make new entries--> restart jenkins

no html pages, instead txt files --> configure global security--> markup formater --> safe html

Jenkins Host key verification failed --> try to run command manually --> so that new entry happens in known_hosts

How to start jenkins on different port rather than 8080 using command prompt in Windows? --> java -jar -hhtps=

How to install a plugin in Jenkins manually--> download .hpi--> put it in ~/.jenkins/plugins

Show current state of Jenkins build on GitHub repo -- > 1. genrate token in github--< cheecke boxes-->paste it in jenkins github credetials-->test--> post build job--> set build status on github commit

Changing Jenkins build number --> jenkins script console --> Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName("YourJobName").updateNextBuildNumber(45)

How do I clone a job in jenkins? --> copy existing job

what is discard old build jobs means : two options : 1: delete job based one no. of days2: delete jobs if certain max no. rached
    its works for deletions of artifacts as well

How to pass variables, that will asked during ongoing builds : this project is parameterized

How to run jobs on specific agents : restrict where the project can be run--> assign agents label

suppose multiple commits at same time, so builds will be in queue : so use quiet period , so jenkins will wait for time after first commit

retry count : make jenkins to check SCM no. of times , to make build starts otherwise than fail

block build from upstream/downstream running : build will be in queu if parent or child running

hwo to checkout specific directory/branch : addtitional behaviour

enable concurrent build for this project : multiple jobs run simultaneously for current project

if you want your build to be run based on some snapshot jar crreation --> Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built

how to trigger based on some scripts remotely or for github trigger with the help of token:  trigger builds remotely 

BUild env:
if you run some commadns or sends some files before running your build (both for before build and after build)--> builf trigger --> send files executes command scheckbox

PRE STEPS/POST STEPS: execute windows batch command-->execute shell--> invoke maven targets--> 

jenkins job configuration stored in --> config.xml--> so to migrate--> either copy job folder and rename or JENKINSCLI:
    list job-->get jobname--> as an xml--> create an job from xml

how to configure jenkins web site root path --> manage jenkins--> copnfigure system

how to stop zombie job in jenkins --> jenkins script console --> Jenkins .instance.getItemByFullName("JobName")
        .getBuildByNumber(JobNumber)
        .finish(hudson.model.Result.ABORTED, new java.io.IOException("Aborting build")); 
        
Jenkins dead but pid file exists --> mostly error with apache port -> chnage jenkins_ajp_port = 8009 in etc/sysconfig/jenkins

host verification failed when cloning from repo--> so you added into known_hosts--> than also same error--> please check for permission on public and private key for ssh--> is it assign to jenkins

from where you can know directory for jenkins.war folder --> manage jenkins--> system info

Jenkins not executing jobs (pending - waiting for next executor) -> might be due to disk space issue in master 

Jenkins - j_acegi_security_check --> tomact gives error after log in --> please enble security --> jenkins users own db and allow sign up

scp from remote to host and host to remote both side possible

a slave.jar is running on slave when you connect jenkins master with slave

Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. ... Swap space can be a dedicated swap partition (recommended), a swap file, or a combination of swap partitions and swap files.

i nned to run dhclient everytime when i boot the server : make an entry in etc/rc.d/rc.local , and make it executable, it will be run during startup

rc.d : run commands .d : directory

How to pass variables from one build to other --> parent build --> trigger/call build on other projects in a any pre/post build steps--> Child build--> parameterized build

two types of pipeline:
   DECLARITIVE
   SCRIPTED : mostly used on specific agents 
   
HOW TO CREATE PIPELINE PROJECT:
    UI - > pipline script
    JEnkinsfile from SCM
    
HOW to genrate pipeline with various selections from jenkins UI options --> 8080/pipeline-syntax --> snippet generator

AGENT DIRECTIVE :

   agent none
   agent any
   agent { label 'my-defined-label' }
   agent { node { label 'labelName' } } same as above but we can also allow custom workspace
SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO RUN THE PIPELINE WITH GIVEN CONTAINER, SO : agent { docker 'maven:3-alpine' }
   agent {
    docker {
        image 'maven:3-alpine'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        args  '-v /tmp:/tmp'
TO USE DOKERFILE< SAME AS ABOVE IMPLEMENTATIOn

COMMON USE OF SPECIFIC AGENT is WITH CUSTOM WORKSPCE:
    agent {
    node {
        label 'my-defined-label'
        customWorkspace '/some/other/path'
    }
}

MAKE COMMAND IS SCANNING MAKE FILE, WHERE CONFIGURATION IS WRITTEN HOW PROGRAM CONNECTED, SO MAKE WILL RECOMPILE WHOLE PROGRAM ACCORDINGLY

How you can call jenkins build from outside jenkins : --> Rest api call with POST method
curl -X POST JENKINS_URL/job/JOB_NAME/build --> but then will show error if CSRF(Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits) enabled--> than need to be pass crumbled request for successfull passing parameters

How to get uaer api token from jenkins for any user--> jenkins-->people-->username-->api token show

How to change Dashboard view in jenkins ---> jenkins --> configure asystem--> new view--> like pipeline view-->dasboard view

what is the difference between REfspec and branch build --> refspec is used when you want to cheout specific branches--> while branch build will build the code from branch you specified after cloning

how to use git clone so that it cant clone git history of the project which saves disk and space --> use shallow clone from advanced git clone options

to checkout only specific folder --> advacennd clone options-->path of the reference repo to use during clone

How to authenticate jenkins from private Github repo--> means if you want just specifc repo to be authenticated with jenkins--> use GITHUB DEPLOY KEYS

GITHUB--> REPO--> SETTINGS--> DEPLOY KEYS--> add a public key from jenkins server

If for above req. Jenkins user not possible, than how to use ssh keys --> generate ssh from another location--> in ssh/config configure try to point out the location of public GITHUB deploy keys-->
