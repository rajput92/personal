Why Ansible:

admin --> logging with ssh --> changing configuration of each and evry env
but if we had same 100's of servers 
configuration management tool --> chef, puppet, 
but admin dont want to learn other language to configure --> so simple ansible

ansible deploy configuration withought any software or agent on client server

shell running more than once --> unintended consequences --> but ansible same configuration for 100's times

Difference Between Update and Upgrade. Updates in computer hardware and software are patches of code that are released in order to address certain issues or to activate specific functionalities. ... An upgrade is the act of replacing your product with a newer, and often more superior, version or similar product.

Ansible INSTALLATION :

PREREquiste :

python-level and python-pip needs to be installed

pip install ansible

If you’re running RedHat or CentOS, you need to install EPEL’s RPM before you install Ansible 
yum install ansible

Need to connect to other machine:
write down host name in inventory:(/etc/hosts)
for ansible : /etc/ansible/hosts

for connecting to remote hosts, if ansible_pass is enabled, than it will give error of adding to known hosts, if disabled, than first it will add it and than you ask for password with -k flag

PYTHON HAS TO BE THERE IN REMOTE MACHINE FOR ANSIBLE TO CONNECT

/etc/ansible/hosts : []to use a group name
[:var] variable for that group
ansible_sshuser/password
