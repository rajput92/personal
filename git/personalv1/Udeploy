docker container exec -it container_id /bin/bash

To find the installer on the server with the command line, go to the following location, and copy the file to the target computer: installation_folder/opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/tools/ibm-ucd-agent.zip

why /opt --> independent source code 

In order to copy a file from a container to the host, you can use the command

docker cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target

Installation has to be root, otherwise it will not copy installation file to /opt/ibm-ucd/agent

go to buin directory and start the agent

If agent is offline, try to configure settings-->system settings--> URL for server
