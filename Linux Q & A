Where all the external packages which we download, are stored, in which directory?

Why we define enviornment variable in $PATH variable, and how we can run command from current directory?

What is file descriptor?, for IN, OUT, and ERROR?

By default file descriptor is connected to which STDIN and STDOUT, and how redirection is useful in redirecting STDIN and STDOUT.

Difference between redirection and pipes ?

Please explain difference between below examples:
ls m.txt > m.txt (m.txt present)
ls m.txt 2> m.txt 
ls m.txt 2>& 1 m.txt
ls etc > m.txt (etc not present)
ls etc 2> m.txt
ls etc 2>& 1 m.txt
ls etc > m.txt 2>&1
